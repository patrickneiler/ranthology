The new product, Sonar, was launched successfully after roughly a year of development.\n* iTradeNetwork - Consultant - I was hired under contract to lead an initiative to produce an Angular component library to be used across their suite of agricultural logistics products.\nThe primary objective was interrupted by a critical and extremely time-sensitive matter during the COVID-19 pandemic. Farmers were in danger of losing their farms due to the disruption in the supply chain.\nI was asked to produce a new app that could act as an open marketplace where farmers could directly interact with alternative buyers.\n\n* Trax Health - Co-Founder - Trax is building a health data marketplace.
